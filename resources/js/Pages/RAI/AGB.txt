In the event we discover that you have circumvented restrictions (for example, by providing false information regarding your residency or using VPN/proxy to appear as if you are in a permitted region), your **account** may be immediately terminated and all transactions (**bets**, **deposits**, **withdrawals**) voided. The Company cannot guarantee the successful processing of **withdrawals** or refunds if you violate the restricted **jurisdictions** policy by accessing the Casino from a **prohibited** **jurisdiction**. Any funds deposited or winnings obtained while in a Restricted **Country** may be confiscated and your **account** closed.

5. **Account** **Registration**

5.1 Personal Account: 
To participate in real-money games on the Website, you must first create a personal player account (“Account”). The registration process will require you to provide truthful, accurate, and complete information, including at least: your full name, date of birth (showing that you are over 18 or the legal age in your jurisdiction), residential address, a valid email address, a unique username and password, and a contact telephone number. You may also be required to provide additional details such as your country of residence and preferred currency. All information you provide in the registration form must match your legal identity (as per your official documents) and be correct and up-to-date. You agree to update your Account information promptly in case of any changes (for example, address or contact number changes) to keep it accurate at all times.

5.2 One Account Rule: 
You are allowed to open only one (1) Account with next2win. Registering multiple accounts by the same individual (including using different identities or email addresses) is strictly prohibited. This one-account policy applies per person, household, address, email, IP address, or device. If you have forgotten your login credentials or believe another account might exist registered to you, contact customer support for assistance rather than creating a duplicate account. Duplicate accounts (also known as “double accounts”) are a serious violation of these Terms. In the event that you create more than one account, whether intentionally or due to an error, the Company reserves the right to immediately shut down the duplicate account(s) and any related accounts. All transactions and bets made via duplicate accounts will be deemed null and void. Furthermore, any bonuses, free spins, winnings, or rewards obtained or accrued through a duplicate account will be forfeited and may be reclaimed by the Company. If we have already paid out funds from a duplicate account, we reserve the right to demand the return of such funds, and you will be liable to repay them to us upon request.

5.3 Account Security: 
Upon registration, you must choose secure login credentials (a strong password). It is your responsibility to keep your username and password confidential and secure. Any activities carried out through your Account will be presumed to be performed by you, and you are solely responsible for all actions and transactions on your Account. You must not share your Account login details with any third party, nor permit any other person (including but not limited to any minors) to use your Account or the Website via your Account. If you suspect that your Account security has been compromised or that any unauthorized person has access to your credentials, you must notify us immediately. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of your Account due to your failure to safeguard your credentials. The Company may request additional information or documentation to verify identity in case of suspicious account activity.

5.4 Email and Communications: 
You must provide a valid email address during registration, which we will use for account verification and ongoing communication. It is your responsibility to ensure you can receive emails from the Casino and that the email remains active. By creating an Account, you agree to receive certain communications from us electronically, such as verification emails, transaction confirmations, password reset links, and notifications about updates to these Terms. You can manage your preferences for marketing or promotional emails as described in Section 10.3 of these Terms.

5.5 Refusal of Registration: 
The Casino reserves the right to refuse to open an account for any applicant at its sole discretion. If any of the registration information you provide is found to be false, incomplete, misleading, or incorrect, this will constitute a breach of these Terms and may result in immediate account closure and nullification of any transactions or winnings, as detailed in Section 8.4 below.

6. **Account** Usage and Maintenance

6.1 Account Use for Personal Entertainment: 
Your Account is intended only for your personal, non-commercial use. You may gamble for your own entertainment and may not use the Website or your Account for any purpose other than lawful gambling in accordance with these Terms. You must not act as an agent or on behalf of any other person, and you must not sell, transfer, or acquire accounts to/from other players. The Account is non-transferable, and under no circumstances is the player permitted to transfer funds or rights from their Account to any other person or account, or vice versa.

6.2 Accurate Information: 
You agree to maintain your Account information current and accurate at all times. The name you provide at registration must match your true legal name. Similarly, any financial accounts (bank account, crypto wallet, etc.) used for deposits or withdrawals must belong to you and be registered in your own name. The Company may at any moment verify the accuracy of the information you have provided and request additional documentation or evidence. Providing false, outdated, or misleading personal information (including identity, residency, payment details or source of funds) is a serious breach of these Terms and could result in account suspension or termination (see Section 8.4).

6.3 Multiple Participation: 
You must not manipulate or influence the Website’s services in collaboration with other players or through usage of multiple accounts. You are prohibited from any form of collusion, team play, or coordinated strategy that gives an unfair advantage at games. You also agree not to exploit any technical glitch, vulnerability, loophole, or error in our software or service for personal gain; if you discover such an issue, you must refrain from exploiting it and promptly report it to the Casino.

6.4 Inactive and Dormant Accounts: 
If you do not log into your Account for a period of at least twelve (12) consecutive months, your Account will be deemed “Inactive.” The Casino will use reasonable efforts to notify you via your registered email before your Account attains inactive status. If your Account remains inactive for twelve months, we reserve the right to charge an administrative maintenance fee of EUR 5 (or equivalent in BTC) per month from the 13th month of inactivity onward, as long as a positive balance remains in your Account. This fee will be deducted from your remaining balance on the date the Account is deemed inactive and each monthly anniversary thereafter. We will cease deducting the fee if the account balance reaches zero or if the account is reactivated by you logging in. If the Account balance is zero, or after 30 months of total inactivity, the Account may be closed. You can reactivate a dormant account by logging in or contacting support, in which case future inactivity fees will stop when the account is active again.

6.5 Account Closure: 
You have the right to close your Account at any time. To close your Account, you should contact our customer support (via email at support@next2win.com) with a request. Our support team will guide you through the process. Upon account closure by you (other than due to self-exclusion, which is covered in Section 9), any remaining real-money balance will be paid out to you (subject to withdrawal rules and KYC verification), and any active bonuses will be forfeited. The Company may also close your Account unilaterally as per Section 11 of these Terms (e.g., for breach of Terms or fraudulent activity). In the event of account closure (by you or by us), the Terms will still apply to any outstanding obligations or pending investigations related to the Account.

7. **Deposits** and **Withdrawals**

Financial transactions on the Website must be made in compliance with the following terms. All monetary values in these Terms are denominated in Euro (EUR) unless stated otherwise.

7.1 Deposits

7.1.1 Payment Methods: 
The Casino currently accepts deposits only via bank transfer and cryptocurrencies. This means you may fund your Account by transferring money from your personal bank account or by sending cryptocurrency (such as Bitcoin) to the wallet addresses provided by the Casino. We do not accept deposits via credit/debit cards, e-wallets, or any other payment method at this time. All deposit transactions must originate from a payment source (bank account or crypto wallet) registered in your own name; third-party payments are strictly prohibited. You agree not to attempt any deposit from a payment account that is not legally and beneficially yours. If we discover that you have deposited funds from an account or card not in your name (a third party), the deposit will be reversed (and returned to the original owner where possible), any winnings arising from such deposit will be confiscated, and the Company will not be liable for any lost funds deposited from third-party accounts.

7.1.2 Accepted Currencies: 
Deposits are accepted in Euro (EUR) and Bitcoin (BTC) only. If you deposit in BTC, it will be credited to your Account in Bitcoin or converted to EUR at the applicable exchange rate at our discretion (the Casino’s internal operating currency is EUR for fiat transactions). The exchange rate for crypto to EUR (if conversion occurs) will be determined by a reputable market rate source at the time of the transaction, and slight differences may occur due to market fluctuations. We do not charge currency conversion fees, but your bank or wallet provider might.

7.1.3 Minimum Deposit: 
The minimum allowed deposit amount is €20 (twenty Euros) or the equivalent in Bitcoin (based on current exchange rate). Deposits below this amount will not be accepted by the system. The maximum deposit amount may vary depending on the method and will be indicated when you choose your payment method. For bank transfers, the limit will depend on your bank’s policies; for BTC, there may be no upper limit on our side, but large deposits may be subject to additional verification per our AML policy.

7.1.4 Depositing Procedure: 
To make a deposit, log in to your Account and visit the Cashier/Deposit page. Select your preferred method (Bank Transfer or Crypto) and follow the on-screen instructions. For bank transfers, you will be provided with our bank details; ensure to include any reference code given so we can credit your Account promptly. For cryptocurrency, you will be provided a unique deposit address or QR code—send the funds from your personal wallet to that exact address. Deposits in cryptocurrency require network confirmations; the time for funds to appear in your Account can vary depending on blockchain network traffic. We credit crypto deposits after a reasonable number of confirmations (e.g., 3 confirmations for BTC).

7.1.5 Fees on Deposits: 
The Casino does not charge any deposit fees. However, your bank or crypto network may impose transaction fees (e.g., wire transfer fees or blockchain miner fees), which are beyond our control. Such charges are your responsibility. The full amount received by us (after any third-party fees) will be credited to your Account.

7.1.6 Deposit Turnover Requirement: 
In accordance with anti-money laundering best practices, all deposits must be wagered at least once in full on the Casino games before a withdrawal can be made. For example, if you deposit €100, you should place bets totaling at least €100 (a 1x turnover) before requesting a withdrawal of those funds. If multiple deposits are made without commensurate gaming activity, you will be required to wager the total of those deposits at least once before withdrawing. The Casino reserves the right to charge a fee (up to 10% of the deposit amount) to cover processing costs for deposits and withdrawals if you request a withdrawal without having met this wagering requirement. This measure is intended to prevent misuse of our system for financial transactions without genuine play. We further reserve the right to refuse a withdrawal of unplayed deposits and/or to close the Account if we suspect deposit/withdrawal abuse.

7.1.7 No Interest & No Financial Advice: 
The funds held in your Account are not a deposit or investment and will not accrue any interest. The Casino is not a financial institution and does not offer any financial services such as loans, currency exchange beyond gaming transactions, or advice on cryptocurrency value changes.

7.2 Withdrawals

7.2.1 Withdrawal Methods: 
Withdrawals of winnings or account balances will typically be processed via the same method used for deposit, whenever possible. Therefore, if you deposited by bank transfer, the default withdrawal method will be bank transfer to the same bank account (or another account in your name if the original cannot receive funds). If you deposited in BTC, withdrawals will be paid to your personal BTC wallet. The Casino may, at its discretion, allow or require an alternative withdrawal method in certain cases (for example, if the original deposit method cannot receive payouts or if a different method is necessary due to technical or regulatory reasons). Any alternate method must still be to a payment account under your name.

7.2.2 Verification Before Payout: 
Identity verification (KYC) is required prior to processing any withdrawal. The Casino reserves the right to verify your identity, age, and place of residence to ensure compliance with these Terms and regulatory requirements before approving a payout. We may ask you to provide certain documents (see Section 8.2) if you have not already done so. Withdrawal requests will be pending (and not processed) until all requested KYC documents are provided and approved. If you fail to provide the necessary verification documents or if we suspect fraudulent or false documentation, the withdrawal may be denied, your Account may be closed, and any balance or winnings may be confiscated in accordance with Section 8.4. In such cases, the Casino shall inform you via email of the account closure or withdrawal denial. Note that in some cases the Casino might be obligated to report such incidents to the appropriate authorities or regulators.

7.2.3 Minimum and Maximum Withdrawal Amounts: 
The minimum withdrawal amount is €25 (twenty-five Euros) or equivalent in BTC for a single transaction. Withdrawal requests below this amount will not be processed. The maximum withdrawal limits are €5,000 per day and up to €30,000 per week (7-day period). These limits apply per player, regardless of method. If you request an amount exceeding the applicable daily or weekly limit, the amount will be paid in installments not exceeding €5,000 per day and €30,000 per week until the full amount is paid out. For example, if you request a €12,000 withdrawal, we may pay out €5,000 on the first day, €5,000 on the next day, and the remaining €2,000 on the following day, observing the daily cap. In cases of exceptionally large wins (e.g., jackpots), the Casino reserves the right to set up a tailored payout plan, but the weekly limit of €30,000 will generally apply. Progressive jackpot winnings, however, are exempt from standard payout limits – any progressive jackpot win will be paid out in full, as a lump sum, after full verification, provided that such payout is permitted by the game supplier.

7.2.4 Withdrawal Processing Time: 
The Casino strives to review and process all withdrawal requests as quickly as possible. Once your account is fully verified and a withdrawal is approved, we typically process the request within 24 hours (one business day). However, the exact time to receive your funds will depend on the payment method and other external factors:

Bank Transfers: After we process a bank transfer **withdrawal**, it may take approximately 3-7 business days for funds to reach your bank **account**. This timeframe can vary depending on inter-bank clearing times and your bank’s processing speed. Please note we cannot process bank **withdrawals** on weekends or public holidays in our **jurisdiction** or that of the banks involved.

Cryptocurrency: After approval, cryptocurrency **withdrawals** are usually sent promptly. You will receive the crypto transaction on the blockchain typically within a few minutes to a couple of hours, depending on network congestion. We will notify you when the BTC **withdrawal** has been executed from our side.

We will do our best to expedite payouts, but delays might occur due to **security** reviews, large volume of concurrent **withdrawal** requests, or if you request an amount that triggers additional **verification** (e.g., large wins).

7.2.5 Withdrawal Fees: 
The Casino does not generally impose a fee for withdrawals. However, for bank transfer withdrawals, intermediary banks or your own bank might deduct charges for international or domestic transfers. These charges are beyond our control and are the player’s responsibility. For cryptocurrency withdrawals, the blockchain network (miners) may charge a transaction fee, which will be deducted from the withdrawal amount or charged to your balance at a standard rate. We will always inform you in advance if any fee is to be applied to your withdrawal.

7.2.6 Withdrawal Limits and Aggregation: 
The maximum withdrawal limits stated (€5,000/day and €30,000/week) are subject to any lower limits that may be imposed by specific payment processors. If the amount you request exceeds the maximum allowed by a particular payment provider or banking channel in a single transaction, we will inform you and may split the payout into multiple transactions or use an alternative method. The Casino’s weekly limit is cumulative across all products; multiple withdrawal requests within the same week are totaled for the purposes of the limit. Any progressive jackpot wins, as noted, will not be limited in this manner and will be paid out fully as a single amount (or as directed by the game provider’s rules).

7.2.7 Reversals and Refunds: 
Once a withdrawal request is submitted, you may have the option to reverse (cancel) it through your account interface while it is still pending, thereby re-crediting the funds to your Casino balance. However, once the withdrawal status changes to "Approved" or "Processed," it can no longer be reversed. Deposits are generally considered final and are not subject to refunds except in the case of extreme circumstances or errors, at the sole discretion of the Casino. If you believe a deposit was made in error or there is a legitimate ground for a refund (for example, potential fraud on your payment method), you may contact support immediately and we will review the request. Approved refunds will be made only to the same source from which the funds originated, wherever possible.

7.2.8 Original Payment Source & Closed Loop Policy: 
In line with our anti-money laundering obligations, withdrawals will typically be processed back to the same payment method used for deposit, up to the amount deposited via that method. For instance, if you deposited €500 via bank transfer and later win €1,000, we will aim to send at least €500 back to that same bank account (treating it as a return of deposit), and the remaining amount can be paid via the same method or an alternative method approved by us. If for some reason the original deposit method cannot receive funds (e.g., certain crypto deposits or one-way payment vouchers), we will require an alternative method in your name for withdrawal, and additional verification might be needed for that method.

7.2.9 Finality of Payments: 
All payments (deposits and withdrawals) are subject to verification checks by the Company. We reserve the right to refuse or reverse any transaction if we suspect it breaches these Terms, is connected to fraudulent activity, or violates any law or regulation. In the event that we mistakenly credit your Account with winnings, funds that do not belong to you, or duplicate payments, those amounts remain property of the Casino and will be deducted from your balance. If you have withdrawn funds that were paid to you in error, the amount will constitute a debt owed by you to the Casino, and you are obliged to return such funds immediately upon notification. We reserve the right to offset any subsequent winnings or balances to recover such erroneous payments.

8. **Player** **Verification** (**KYC**) and **Anti-Money Laundering**

8.1 Know Your Customer (KYC) Policy: 
To maintain a secure and legally compliant gaming environment, next2win follows a thorough KYC (Know Your Customer) procedure for verifying the identity of our players. By agreeing to these Terms, you authorize the Company to perform any verification checks, either directly or through third-party services, as may be required at our discretion or as demanded by applicable laws and regulations. These checks may be conducted at the time of registration, during processing of deposits or withdrawals, or at any other times (on a random or risk-based frequency). Verification checks are used to confirm your identity, age, address, payment source, and to prevent fraudulent activities such as identity theft, money laundering, or use of our services by unauthorized persons.

8.2 Identity and Address Verification: 
You may be required to submit documents to verify your identity and address as part of the KYC process. Such KYC documents include, but are not limited to:

A valid government-issued photo ID (e.g., passport, national ID card, or driver’s license) clearly showing your name and date of birth;

Proof of **address**, such as a recent utility bill or bank statement (not older than 3 months) that shows your name and residential **address**;

Proof of ownership of any payment method used, if applicable (for example, a photo of the bank card used showing your name, or a screenshot of your e-wallet or crypto wallet transaction);

In certain cases, a selfie or photograph of you holding your ID or a video **verification** call may be requested to confirm liveness and likeness;

Any other **documents** that we deem necessary to complete our checks (for example, proof of source of funds or wealth, in compliance with **AML** regulations, if your transaction volumes trigger such requirement).

All **documents** must be clear, legible, and not altered or edited. We maintain strict confidentiality of the **documents** you provide, as outlined in our **Privacy** Policy, and use them solely for compliance purposes.

8.3 Source of Funds and Anti-Money Laundering: 
The Company is committed to anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing efforts. We may therefore ask for information or documentation related to the origin of funds you use for gambling. By using our services, you guarantee that all money you deposit comes from legitimate sources and is not tainted by any illegal activity. The Casino’s systems and staff are trained to monitor player activities and to report any suspicious transactions or behaviors to the relevant authorities as required under applicable AML laws
casiqo.com
. Activities that could be considered indicators of money laundering (e.g., sudden large **deposits** and **withdrawal** without corresponding gameplay, multiple **accounts**, etc.) will prompt additional scrutiny and could lead to **suspension** of the **account**.

We reserve the right to block, freeze, or hold any funds in your **Account** and suspend your access to the Website pending the outcome of any investigation of suspicious activity. In addition, if we have reasonable grounds to suspect that any activities on your **Account** may violate **AML** laws or these Terms, we may refuse to execute a transaction, reverse a transaction, and/or close the **Account**. The proper authorities may be contacted in cases of suspected money laundering or other criminal activities, and you agree that the Company may share your information with such authorities if required by law.

8.4 Failure to Pass Verification: 
If you fail to complete the KYC verification to our satisfaction (for example, if you refuse to provide required documents, or if you provide false or misleading information, or if the information you provided does not match the documents), the Casino reserves the right to take any or all of the following actions: (a) decline to open an Account, or immediately suspend or terminate your existing Account; (b) void and forfeit all bonuses and winnings to date on the Account; (c) return any remaining deposit balance to you (unless prohibited by law or these Terms, or if funds are suspected to be the proceeds of fraud), minus any reasonable processing fees, and (d) report the incident to relevant regulatory or law enforcement bodies if necessary. Providing false personal data or fraudulent documents is considered a material breach of these Terms. In the event of such breach, the Company shall have no obligation to pay out any funds from the Account, except perhaps the return of original deposits (subject to any damages or costs we incur and applicable laws). You also agree that the Casino shall not be liable for any inability to withdraw or use your Account if you have not complied with verification requests.

8.5 Duration of Verification: 
We strive to review all documents as quickly as possible. Typically, verification of standard KYC documents is completed within a few days. However, in some cases (especially for complex cases or high-volume periods) the review might take up to 30 business days from the time we receive all requested documents. This timeframe is a maximum estimate and we appreciate your patience during the verification process. You will be informed of the outcome of the verification. During an active verification process (especially after a withdrawal request), withdrawals will remain pending.

8.6 Ongoing Monitoring: 
Even after your account is verified initially, the Company may perform additional KYC or source-of-funds checks at its discretion, especially when your transactional behavior changes or when you reach certain thresholds of activity. This is both to comply with regulatory obligations and to ensure continued security of your account. You agree to cooperate with us in these checks. We may also periodically verify that your registration data is still accurate; for example, we might ask if your address or payment details have changed.

8.7 Confidentiality: 
We handle all player data and documents in line with our Privacy Policy and applicable data protection laws. All documents you send are accessible only to authorized compliance personnel and are stored securely. They will not be used for any purpose other than verification and legal compliance, unless you grant permission or we are required by law to use them otherwise. Please note that by law we are required to retain certain identification and transactional data for a minimum period (e.g., five years) after the end of the business relationship or a transaction, to comply with AML recordkeeping laws.

9. **Responsible Gambling**

9.1 Commitment to Responsible Gaming: 
Next2win is committed to providing a platform for responsible entertainment. We recognize that while gambling is a form of entertainment for most, for some it can become a problem. We have measures in place to promote responsible gambling and help you manage your play. Gambling should be done in moderation and not as a means of financial gain. You acknowledge that you play at your own risk and discretion, and the Casino is not liable for any psychological or financial consequences of your gambling activities.

9.2 Self-Imposed Limits: 
We offer all players the ability to set personal limits on their gambling to help manage their spending and time. These limits can include (where available in your Account settings or by contacting support):

**Deposit** **Limits**: Restrict the total amount you can **deposit** into your **account** per day, week, or month.

Loss **Limits**: Cap the net amount you can lose (**deposits** minus **withdrawals**) over a selected period.

**Wagering**/**Bet** **Limits**: **Limit** the total amount you can **wager** within a specified timeframe.

Session Time **Limits**: Set a maximum duration for each session or a reminder that informs you when you have been playing for a set time.

If you would like to impose any of these **limits** on your **account**, you may do so through the responsible gaming section of your **account** profile (if available) or by contacting our customer support with your request. Any requested **limit** will be applied as soon as possible upon receipt of your request (or immediately if set through the automated tools). Decreasing **limits** (making them more strict) will take effect immediately; increasing or removing **limits** may take a cooling-off period (e.g., 24 hours or 7 days) before coming into effect, to prevent impulsive changes. These **limits** are available to help you gamble within your means.

9.3 Self-Exclusion: 
If you feel that you are losing control of your gambling or just wish to take a break from gambling, we provide a self-exclusion option. Self-exclusion means your account will be locked for a chosen period, during which you will not be able to log in, deposit, or gamble. To self-exclude, you can use the tool in your Account settings or contact support specifying that you want to self-exclude and for what duration (e.g., 6 months, 1 year, or indefinitely). We will enforce your self-exclusion as soon as possible after your request. During a self-exclusion period, the Casino will do its best to prevent any new accounts from being opened by you (we may use your personal details to block any new attempts). Any remaining balance in your account at the time of self-exclusion can be withdrawn (subject to verification) by contacting support, but you will not be able to engage in any gambling activities. You should not attempt to circumvent a self-exclusion by creating new accounts or changing details — if you are found doing so, we reserve the right to permanently ban you from the Website. After a self-exclusion period ends, you may contact support to have your account reactivated (except in cases of indefinite or permanent exclusion). There will be a mandatory evaluation by our support team and a cooling-off period before reactivation.

9.4 Minor Protection: 
The Website is strictly for users who are 18 or older (or legal gambling age in their jurisdiction). We actively discourage and prevent underage access. Parents or guardians are strongly urged to take precautions to prevent minors from accessing gambling sites. If there are minors in your household, consider using parental control software or internet filters (such as CyberPatrol, GamBlock, or NetNanny) to block gambling websites. If we suspect an account is being used by a minor, we reserve the right to request immediate proof of age and suspend the account until adequate verification is received.

9.5 Problem Gambling Resources: 
We encourage players to gamble responsibly and seek help if they suspect they have a gambling problem. Warning signs include feeling a loss of control over your gambling, chasing losses, or gambling impacting your daily life and relationships. If you or someone you know has a gambling problem, we recommend seeking assistance from professional organizations. Resources include:

Gamblers Anonymous (http://www.gamblersanonymous.org) – a fellowship of people who have come together to share their experiences to help each other recover from gambling problems.

Gambling Therapy (http://www.gamblingtherapy.org) – offers online support for problem gamblers.

National Problem Gambling Helplines – **country**-specific helplines (for example, in the US: 1-800-522-4700; in the UK: 0808 8020 133).

Information on these and additional **responsible gambling** tools can be found on our Responsible Gaming page or by contacting our support team. Our customer support staff may also reach out if they identify signs of potential problem gambling on your **account**, and they can discuss setting **limits** or **self-exclusion** if appropriate.

9.6 No Underage or Compulsive Gambling Liability: 
The Company shall not be held responsible if you continue gambling excessively or if you circumvent our responsible gaming measures (limits or self-exclusion) by fraudulent means or by providing false information. We will, however, do our utmost to enforce our policies and help you gamble safely. You agree that the Casino is not liable for any losses or damages arising from your voluntary decision to gamble beyond your personal limits. Responsible gambling requires cooperation between the Casino and the player.

10. **Bonuses** and Promotions

10.1 Welcome Bonus – Free Spins: 
Next2win may offer a one-time Welcome Bonus to new players in the form of free spins on specified slot game(s). No other regular bonuses (such as deposit match bonuses or cashback) are currently offered, and there is no VIP or loyalty program in operation at this time (no loyalty points or tiered rewards) as of the effective date of these Terms. The welcome free spins bonus, if offered, will be credited to eligible players upon fulfilling the required conditions (for example, successfully registering and verifying an account, and possibly making a first deposit if the offer is a deposit-triggered bonus – refer to the specific promotion details on the site). The number of free spins and the game(s) on which they can be used will be specified in the bonus offer on the Website.

10.2 Wagering Requirements: 
Winnings obtained from free spins are subject to a wagering requirement before they can be withdrawn. Specifically, any winnings generated by the welcome free spins bonus must be wagered 40 times (40x)
fastoffshore.com
 their value. For example, if you won €10 from the **free spins**, you must place €400 in **bets** before those €10 (and any associated winnings) become eligible for **withdrawal**. Until the **wagering requirement** is met, the **bonus** winnings are considered **bonus** funds and will be locked for **withdrawal**. Only once you have completed the required **wagering** will the **bonus** winnings be converted to real withdrawable money.

10.3 Bonus Usage and Restrictions: 
All bonuses are limited to one per player, household, address, computer, or IP, unless stated otherwise. The welcome free spins bonus is only available to first-time new players. If we detect any attempt to claim multiple welcome bonuses (e.g., by creating multiple accounts, see Section 5.2) or any form of bonus abuse, all related accounts may be suspended and any bonus funds or winnings voided. Bonus offers are made in good faith for recreational players; professional gamblers or syndicates may be restricted from receiving bonuses. The free spins must be used within the time frame specified (commonly, free spins will expire if not used within a certain number of days from issuance – refer to the specific promotion terms, if any, for the exact expiry). If not specified, assume the free spins and any pending winnings from them expire 7 days after being credited.

While a **bonus** is active (before **wagering requirements** are met), not all games may count 100% towards **wagering**. Typically, **bets** on slot games count 100% toward **wagering requirements**, while **bets** on other game types (like roulette, blackjack, or other table games) might count at a reduced rate or not at all. Since next2win’s welcome **bonus** is **free spins** (slot-based), this may not be an issue; however, if any other promotion with **wagering** is offered, its terms will detail game contribution percentages. Additionally, playing deliberately low-risk strategies or irregular **betting** patterns to clear **wagering** (such as **betting** both red and black in roulette, or minimal-risk **betting**) can be deemed **bonus** abuse. The Casino reserves the right to void **bonuses** and any related winnings if we determine that a **player** attempted to exploit a **bonus** or did not fulfill it in the intended spirit.

10.4 Withdrawal of Bonus Funds: 
You may request a withdrawal of your deposit or real-money funds before fulfilling wagering requirements, but doing so will result in forfeiture of any active bonus and associated winnings. If you wish to withdraw before meeting the wagering requirement, you must contact support to remove the bonus; your real-money deposit (minus any losses) will then be withdrawable, but you will lose the bonus spins and any winnings from them. The Casino has the right to refuse a withdrawal if a bonus is still active and wagering is not completed, until the bonus is cancelled by you or wagering finished.

10.5 General Promotion Terms: 
All promotions are subject to these General Terms and any Specific Terms advertised for that promotion. In case of any conflict between these Terms and the specific promotion terms, the latter will prevail for that particular promotion. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or cancel promotions at any time. This includes the right to revoke bonuses or prizes if we suspect any form of collusion or fraud. All bonus offers are intended for leisure players; the Company reserves the right to limit eligibility for any bonus or promotion at its sole discretion.

10.6 Opting Out: 
Receiving the welcome free spins or other promotional offers is optional. If you do not wish to receive a particular bonus, you may decline it when signing up or notify customer support. Additionally, by registering an account, you may be asked to opt-in to receive promotional communications via email or SMS. If you agree, we may send you bonus offers or marketing messages. You can opt out of marketing communications at any time by using the unsubscribe link in emails or contacting support. Opting out of communications will not cancel any active bonuses you have, it simply stops future promotional offers from being sent.

10.7 No VIP Program: 
As noted, the Casino does not currently run a VIP or loyalty program. There are no loyalty points, reward tiers, or special cashback schemes available to players beyond standard promotions. Should a VIP or loyalty scheme be introduced in the future, it will be governed by separate terms and conditions, and these Terms will be updated accordingly.

11. **Prohibited** Activities and **Account** **Termination**

11.1 Fraudulent Activity: 
The Company maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards fraudulent activity of any kind. If we determine or suspect that you have engaged in any form of fraud, cheating, collusion, unlawful or improper activity in relation to your use of the Casino, or if you have otherwise breached these Terms, we reserve the right to take immediate action. Prohibited activities include, but are not limited to: attempting to gain unauthorized access to the Website or systems (hacking), using bots or automated software to play, exploiting software or game glitches, manipulating game outcomes, using stolen payment information or unauthorized payment methods, and any form of fraudulent payment (including chargebacks or credit card reversals).

11.2 Multiple Account & Bonus Abuse: 
As stated in Section 5.2, the creation of more than one account per player is prohibited. If the Casino discovers that you have created duplicate accounts in order to circumvent betting limits, receive multiple bonuses, or for any other reason, we will close such accounts. Additionally, behaviors such as bonus abuse (e.g., redeeming multiple sign-up bonuses, exploiting promotional loopholes, or coordinating with others to abuse promotions) fall under prohibited activities. All winnings obtained through such abuse will be void. The Company may also withdraw any remaining real-money balance (excluding your original deposits, subject to any fees) from duplicate or abuse accounts at its discretion.

11.3 Illegal Activities and Money Laundering: 
You must not use the Website in any way for unlawful purposes or in furtherance of illegal activities as per your local laws or the laws of the Company’s jurisdiction. You are expressly prohibited from using the Casino as a means to launder money, finance terrorism, or conduct any criminal enterprise. You also agree not to obtain funds from criminal or unauthorized activities to deposit into your gambling account. The Company will monitor for and report any suspicious transactions to relevant authorities in compliance with our AML obligations
casiqo.com
. Any attempt to use our services for illicit financial activity will result in **account** **termination** and may be reported to law enforcement.

11.4 Collusion and Cheating: 
Any kind of collusion between players—where two or more players work together to gain an unfair advantage in a game—is strictly forbidden. This includes sharing information about hands in poker (if applicable), manipulating game outcomes, or forming a syndicate to influence gameplay. You must not cheat or employ any strategy that is deliberately designed to exploit a fault or loophole in our software. If you are found to be cheating or colluding, your games will be invalidated, your account terminated, and any winnings forfeited. The Casino’s systems are equipped to detect patterns of collusion or cheating, and we investigate all player reports and unusual gameplay behaviors.

11.5 Offensive or Illegal Content: 
You are prohibited from posting or transmitting any unlawful, harassing, abusive, libelous, threatening, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, or otherwise objectionable material of any kind (including in any chat or interaction with Casino staff or other players, if such features exist on the platform). Any breach of this nature may result in immediate account closure. This extends to user account nicknames or chat handles; any chosen alias that is inappropriate or offensive may be changed by us and your account possibly suspended until an acceptable name is provided.

11.6 Breach of Terms – Consequences: 
If the Company has reasonable grounds to believe that you have engaged in any of the prohibited activities listed in this section or any other breach of these Terms, we have the right to take one or several of the following actions, with or without prior notice to you:

Suspend your **Account** (preventing all play and transactions) pending further investigation;

Terminate your **Account** permanently and bar you from future use of our services;

Withhold or confiscate all or part of the balance and/or winnings in your **Account**, particularly if they are suspected to be related to or derived from **prohibited** conduct;

Void any pending **bets** or wagers that are suspected to be placed as part of **prohibited** conduct;

Refuse to award or allow **withdrawal** of any **bonus** or promotion if we suspect abuse;

Seek legal action against you (criminal or civil) in case of **fraud**, fraudulent misrepresentation, collusion, or other illegal conduct;

Report the matter to appropriate law enforcement or regulatory authorities, if applicable, and provide them with your personal information and details of the suspected misconduct.

The Company’s decision in such cases is final and binding. You acknowledge that the Casino is the final arbiter of any activities on the Website and any games or transactions you partake in. If your **account** is closed due to violation of these Terms or **fraud**, the Company will honor any legitimate obligations to regulatory bodies but is under no obligation to reimburse or compensate you for funds that were forfeited due to **breach** of Terms.

11.7 Indemnification: 
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Casino, its directors, employees, partners, and service providers from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or costs (including legal fees) arising out of or related to your breach of these Terms, your fraudulent or illegal activities, or your misuse of the Website. This obligation survives any termination of these Terms.

12. Limitation of **Liability**

12.1 Gambling Risk: 
You fully understand and agree that participating in the games and services on next2win.pro is at your own risk. The Casino’s services are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, without any warranty or guarantee, either explicit or implied. Gambling by its nature involves risk of monetary loss, and the Casino is not responsible for any losses you may incur as a result of your use of our services. You acknowledge that you are aware that you may lose money by gambling on the Website and you are responsible for any such loss.

12.2 No Warranty: 
The Company makes no representation or warranty that the services will meet your expectations, be uninterrupted, timely, or error-free, or that any defects will be corrected promptly. The Casino does not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information provided (such as game results, jackpot amounts in real-time, etc.). To the fullest extent permitted by law, we exclude all conditions, warranties, or other terms which might otherwise be implied by statute or law.

12.3 Technical Failures: 
The Casino, its software providers, and partners are not liable for any downtime, server disruptions, lagging, or any technical or political disturbance to the game play. Hardware or software malfunctions, poor or lost internet connectivity, or other technical errors can happen and the Casino is not responsible for such occurrences. If a game is started but miscarries or crashes because of a failure of our system, we will refund the bet amount for the game to you (if applicable), or otherwise ensure you are not unfairly disadvantaged by the interruption. The Company disclaims any liability for IT failures, bugs, or viruses that result in system errors or data losses. In the event of a miscommunication or error in displaying any game or transaction result, the transaction as recorded in our systems (or the game provider’s systems) will be deemed the official and final outcome. We will strive to resolve any such issues in a timely manner.

12.4 Errors and Mistakes: 
In the rare event that a bet is mistakenly accepted or a payment is made by us in error (for example, due to a human or technical error, or an obvious mistake in odds or game software), the Company reserves the right to correct the mistake by adjusting the bet or account balance appropriately. If we mistakenly credit your account with winnings that do not belong to you, whether due to a technical glitch or human error, the amount is not deemed your property and will be deducted from your account. If you have withdrawn such funds before the error is noticed, the amount constitutes a debt owed by you to us. In case of such errors, the bet or game round in question may be voided and wagers returned (if applicable), or settled correctly at the Company’s discretion. We will inform you of the correction and the reasons.

12.5 Liability Cap: 
To the extent permitted by law, in no event shall the Casino’s cumulative liability to you exceed the amount of the deposits you have made in your Account in the preceding six (6) months period. The Casino (including its parent, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, and employees) shall not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages whatsoever (including, for example, damages for loss of profits, business interruption, loss of data, or other pecuniary loss), whether in contract, tort, negligence, or otherwise, arising out of or in connection with your use of the Website or participation in the games, even if we have been advised of or should have known of the possibility of such damages.

12.6 Third-Party Content: 
The Website may contain links to external websites or services (e.g., game provider policies, responsible gaming websites, payment provider sites). The Company is not responsible for the content, products, or services of any third-party websites, which are governed by their own terms and privacy policies. Following a link to any external site is at your own risk; we do not endorse or guarantee the information contained therein.

12.7 Service “AS-IS”: 
We aim for accuracy in the information presented on the Website. However, any information (such as game rules, payout ratios, odds, betting tips, etc.) is provided for convenience and should not be construed as advice or a guarantee of outcome. The Casino makes no warranty that the software and Website will be fit for purpose, free of errors, or that any defects will be corrected. We do guarantee that we will make reasonable efforts to resolve any issues within our control and that games are operated fairly and transparently according to the relevant rules and RNG (Random Number Generator) certifications.

12.8 Indemnification: 
You agree that the Casino, its employees, partners, and service providers are indemnified, defended and held harmless by you from any claims, liabilities, costs, or damages arising out of your breach of these Terms, violation of any law, or infringement of third-party rights, or any use of the services by any other person accessing them using your account credentials (whether with your permission or due to your negligence).

12.9 Final Decision: 
You acknowledge that the Casino shall be the final decision-maker of whether you have violated the Casino’s rules or these Terms in a manner that results in your suspension or permanent ban from participation on the Website. Any dispute regarding game outcomes will be resolved by reference to our server logs, and our records shall be the final authority in deciding such matters. This clause does not restrict your rights to pursue valid disputes through external means (see Section 14 on Dispute Resolution), but until such resolution, the Company’s decision will stand.

Notice: Nothing in this Section 12 is intended to exclude **liability** for personal injury or death resulting from our negligence, or for **fraud** or fraudulent misrepresentation on our part, or any other **liability** that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law. Some **jurisdictions** do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of **liability** for incidental or consequential damages; in such **jurisdictions**, our **liability** shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.

13. Intellectual Property

13.1 Ownership of Content: 
All content on the next2win Website, including but not limited to software, source code, graphics, text, logos, images, audio, video, designs, user interface, and any other materials, is the intellectual property of the Company or its licensors and is protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. The “next2win” name and logo, as well as all product and service names displayed on the site, are trademarks or registered trademarks of the Company (or its affiliates or partners). Any unauthorized use of our intellectual property is strictly prohibited.

13.2 Limited License: 
We grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the Website and its content for the sole purpose of participating in the online casino games and services in accordance with these Terms. Any other use of the Website or its materials is not permitted. You may not copy, redistribute, publish, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify, or translate the website software or content, nor create any derivative works from it, without the express prior written consent of the Company.

13.3 User Content: 
If you communicate or upload any content to the Website (for example, in chat, forums, reviews, or feedback), you hereby grant the Company a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable license to use, reproduce, modify, or adapt such content for any purpose related to the Website. You represent that any such content is free of viruses and does not infringe on any third-party rights. The Company reserves the right to remove any user-submitted content that violates these Terms or is deemed inappropriate.

13.4 Software Use: 
The Casino's games and software are provided for gameplay on our platform only. You must not use any third-party software or tools that manipulate our games or provide unfair advantage (such as bots, automated scripts, cheating software). The use of artificial intelligence or any non-human interface to interact with the games is forbidden. Additionally, any software we provide to you (e.g., a mobile app or downloadable client, if any) is for your personal use under these Terms. You shall not redistribute or attempt to hack or alter that software.

13.5 Third-Party Rights: 
Some content on the site may be owned by third-party providers (such as game developers). These third parties retain the rights to their content, and your use of such content is subject to these Terms and any additional terms imposed by those third parties (for example, you may be required to agree to an end-user license agreement when playing certain games). You agree to respect all copyright and proprietary notices on the Website. If you become aware of any unauthorized distribution or exploitation of the Website or its content (for instance, pirated games or someone copying our website design), you should notify the Company promptly.

14. **Complaints** and **Dispute** Resolution

14.1 Customer Support: 
Our aim is to ensure that you have an enjoyable experience at next2win. If you have any questions, concerns, or complaints regarding our services, you should first contact our Customer Support team. You can reach us at support@next2win.com. Our support team will review your issue and try to resolve it as soon as possible. Please provide as much detail as you can about the problem (e.g., date and time of incident, game played, any reference numbers, screenshots if available) to assist us in investigating your complaint efficiently.

14.2 Complaint Process: 
When a complaint is received, it is initially handled by our support representatives. They will log the complaint and attempt to resolve it in a fair and swift manner. If the support team cannot resolve the issue immediately, or if it requires further investigation, they may escalate it to Casino management. You will be informed that the matter has been escalated. We aim to acknowledge receipt of a complaint within 24 hours and to provide a resolution or update within 10 business days. Some complex issues may take longer to fully investigate, but we will keep you informed of the progress.

14.3 Disputes about Game Outcomes or Transactions: 
If your complaint is about a specific game result, betting outcome, or a financial transaction, we will compare the information you provided with our internal logs and transaction records. The data recorded on the game server will be the final authority in determining the outcome of any dispute (for example, whether you won a particular game round or the balance changes on your account). In case of any discrepancy between what appears on your screen and what is recorded in our database, the latter will prevail, and our calculation of your account balance and game outcomes shall be deemed correct.

14.4 Final Decision of the Casino: 
We sincerely hope to resolve all complaints to your satisfaction. However, if you remain unsatisfied with the final response provided by our support management (for instance, if we find your complaint unjustified or we cannot agree on a solution), the matter can be considered a dispute. In such cases, the Casino's position will be made clear to you in our final response. We strive to be fair, but you acknowledge that the Casino shall be the final decision-maker in internal complaints, and our decision will be conclusive insofar as it relates to our own policies and Terms.

14.5 External Dispute Resolution: 
If you are not satisfied with the resolution of your complaint by the Casino, you have the right to seek external redress. Because next2win is licensed in Anjouan, you may contact the Anjouan Gaming Authority or the relevant regulatory body that oversees online gambling for Anjouan licensees. We will provide guidance on how to contact this authority upon request. Additionally, you may use an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) service or an independent mediator if one is available. We will cooperate fully with any legitimate mediators or regulators to resolve the dispute. Initiating a dispute with a regulator or ADR should typically be done only after exhausting the Casino’s internal complaint process described above.

14.6 Submission of Complaints: 
You agree to submit any complaints as soon as possible after the issue arises, to ensure that the details are fresh and events can be accurately traced. Complaints filed more than 6 months after the incident may be more difficult to resolve, and we reserve the right not to entertain extremely old complaints if the evidence or records are no longer available.

14.7 Responsible Engagement: 
When a dispute is under review by an external party (regulator or ADR), you agree not to modify or delete any information in your account relevant to the dispute until it is resolved. The Company also agrees to maintain relevant records. Both parties should act in good faith during the dispute resolution process.

14.8 Frivolous or Bad-Faith Complaints: 
If the Casino finds that a user has made malicious, frivolous, or baseless complaints (for example, fabricating facts or omitting important information intentionally), we reserve the right to terminate the user’s account and refuse any further services. This measure would only be taken in extreme cases where a user is abusing the complaint process with dishonest intent.

14.9 Language of Complaints: 
These Terms are provided in English, and we offer customer support in English. Complaints should ideally be submitted in English to avoid miscommunication. If you submit a complaint in another language, we may need additional time to have it translated and addressed.

14.10 Records: 
The Company will keep an internal record of all customer complaints and their outcomes. This helps us improve our services and ensures compliance with regulatory requirements. Complaint records are kept confidential and are only shared with regulatory authorities if they request it or if we are required by law.

15. **Governing Law** and **Jurisdiction**

15.1 Governing Law: 
These Terms and Conditions, and any matters relating to them, are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of Anjouan, in the Union of Comoros, which is the jurisdiction of the Company’s gaming license. All transactions and interactions between you and the Company are deemed to have occurred in Anjouan.

15.2 Jurisdiction: 
You agree that any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach thereof, that cannot be resolved through the complaint process in Section 14, shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts of Anjouan (Union of the Comoros). By accepting these Terms, you waive any objection to the venue of any legal proceedings in Anjouan courts on grounds of forum non conveniens or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company retains the right to bring legal proceedings against you in the country of your residence or location if the claim relates to your breach of these Terms and such jurisdiction is necessary to enforce judgments or legal actions.

15.3 Compliance with Local Laws: 
It is the user’s responsibility to ensure that they comply with any and all local laws that might apply to online gambling in their jurisdiction. The Company shall not be liable for any illegal or unauthorized use of the Website by you. The fact that the Website is accessible in your jurisdiction or that it supports the language of your region does not constitute a representation or warranty that our services are legal in your jurisdiction. Use of the Website is void where prohibited by law.

15.4 Severability: 
If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable under applicable law, such provision shall be severed from the remainder of the Terms, which will remain valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. In such cases, the part deemed invalid or unenforceable will be interpreted in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as closely as possible, the original intent of the provision.

15.5 No Waiver: 
The Company’s failure to enforce any provision of these Terms (for example, not taking immediate action for a breach by you) shall not be construed as a waiver of the Company’s right to enforce that provision in the future. A waiver of any provision shall only be effective if made in writing by an authorized representative of the Company.

15.6 Assignment: 
The Company reserves the right to assign or otherwise lawfully transfer this agreement. For instance, if the Company undergoes a business transition like a merger, acquisition, or transfer of assets to another operator, your Account and the contractual relationship outlined in these Terms may be transferred to the succeeding company. You will be notified in such event, and the new operator will uphold the obligations to you under these Terms. You may not assign or transfer your rights or obligations under these Terms to any other party.

15.7 Entire Agreement: 
These Terms and Conditions, along with the Privacy Policy and any game rules or promotion-specific terms, constitute the entire agreement between you and next2win with respect to the use of the Website and services, and supersede all prior understandings or agreements (whether oral or written) regarding the same subject matter. You acknowledge that no representation or statement, other than those expressly set out in these Terms, has induced you to agree to these Terms.

15.8 Effective Date: 
These Terms and Conditions are effective as of the date [Date] (last updated date). They remain in force until replaced by a newer version. If you created an account or continued to use the Website after this date, you are deemed to have accepted these Terms.

If you have any questions or concerns about these Terms and Conditions, please contact us at support@next2win.com for clarification. Thank you for reading and agreeing to these Terms – we wish you an enjoyable and safe gaming experience at next2win.
