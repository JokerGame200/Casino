1. **Introduction**
By accessing and using this Website (the **Website** or **Company**) and its gambling services, you acknowledge and accept our commitment to **Safer Gambling**. This Safer Gambling Policy (the **Policy**) outlines our dedication to responsible gaming, player protection measures, and compliance with the regulatory requirements of our **Anjouan** gaming license. Gambling should be an enjoyable form of entertainment; however, it carries risks if not conducted responsibly. We therefore implement robust policies and tools to ensure a safe and controlled gaming environment for all players.

1.1 **Purpose and Scope**  
This **Policy** applies to all players and visitors of the **Website**. It explains the safeguards we have in place to prevent problem gambling and to protect vulnerable individuals. All employees of the **Company** are trained to uphold these standards. This **Policy** should be read in conjunction with our **Terms & Conditions**, and it complements protections described in our **Privacy Policy** and **KYC Policy**.

1.2 **Regulatory Compliance**  
As a licensed online casino under **Anjouan** jurisdiction, we adhere to strict regulations on player protection and responsible gambling. We promote responsible gaming and implement measures to mitigate gambling-related harm. In compliance with these obligations, we offer a range of player protection tools (Section **3**) and maintain procedures to prevent underage gambling, detect signs of problem gambling, and intervene when necessary. We are committed to meeting and exceeding the responsible gaming standards set forth by our licensing authority.

1.3 **Our Commitment**  
We are committed to a secure and enjoyable gaming environment founded on **prevention**, **protection**, and **support**:  
- **Prevention:** Implementing controls to help you stay within safe limits and avoid developing gambling problems.  
- **Protection:** Safeguarding minors and vulnerable persons by strictly prohibiting underage gambling and offering **Self‑Exclusion** and other protective measures.  
- **Support:** Encouraging responsible play and providing information on how to seek help from our team and tools.

2. **Prevention of Underage Gambling**
2.1 **Age Verification**  
Gambling by minors (individuals under **18** years of age, or higher minimum age as required by your local law) is strictly prohibited. During registration and **KYC (Know Your Customer)**, players must provide valid identification documents. The **Company** verifies the age of new customers and may request additional proof at any time. If we suspect an account is used by a minor, it will be suspended pending investigation and age confirmation.

2.2 **Protection of Minors**  
Players should take active steps to prevent minors from accessing gambling websites. If you share devices with underage individuals, please use parental controls to restrict access to gambling content. The **Company** ensures that its marketing and advertising are not directed towards minors. Any breach of this policy will result in account closure and potential reporting to the relevant authorities.

3. **Player Protection Tools**
We provide the following responsible gaming tools to help you manage your play and spend responsibly. These tools are available in your account settings or via **Customer Support**. We encourage you to use them to stay in control.

3.1 **Deposit Limits**  
Set **Deposit Limits** to control the amount you deposit over a daily, weekly, or monthly period. Lowering limits takes effect immediately; increasing or removing limits is subject to a **cooling‑off period** to prevent impulsive changes.

3.2 **Loss Limits**  
Apply **Loss Limits** to cap the net amount you can lose within a chosen time frame. Reaching the limit prevents further betting until the period resets. Tightening limits is immediate; loosening them may require a waiting period and confirmation.

3.3 **Session Time Limits**  
Use **Session Time Limits** to set the maximum duration of continuous play (e.g., **60** minutes). On reaching the limit, you will be alerted or logged out, encouraging regular breaks and preventing excessively long sessions.

3.4 **Reality Checks**  
Enable **Reality Checks** (periodic on‑screen reminders) to show how long you have been playing and, where available, how much you have wagered or lost during the interval. You can customize the frequency in your settings.

3.5 **Self‑Exclusion**  
If you need an extended break, activate **Self‑Exclusion**. You may choose a minimum period (e.g., **6** months) up to an indefinite exclusion. During **Self‑Exclusion**, you cannot log in, deposit, or gamble, and you will not receive marketing communications from us. Remaining balances may be returned subject to verification and any outstanding obligations. **Self‑Exclusion** is irreversible for the selected duration.

**Cooling‑Off (Time‑Out) Periods:** In addition to **Self‑Exclusion**, you may set shorter **Cooling‑Off** periods (e.g., **24** hours, **7** days, or several weeks). During **Cooling‑Off**, your account is temporarily suspended and reactivates automatically once the period ends.

4. **Additional Responsible Gaming Measures**
4.1 **Account Monitoring and Intervention**  
We monitor accounts for indicators of problematic behavior (e.g., sudden changes in wagering, extended play, or distress signals). Where risk is identified, we may intervene—such as proposing limits, applying a **Cooling‑Off** period, or temporarily suspending the account—to protect player welfare.

4.2 **No Credit Policy**  
We operate a **No Credit Policy**. We do not extend credit for gambling. All wagering must be funded from your deposited balance. This reduces the risk of gambling‑related debt and supports responsible play.

4.3 **Training and Awareness**  
Our teams receive **Responsible Gambling** training and follow procedures aligned with licensing requirements and industry best practices. We regularly review the effectiveness of our measures and enhance them where appropriate.

4.4 **Player Self‑Assessment**  
We provide basic **Self‑Assessment** information to help you evaluate your gambling habits. If gambling begins to impact your finances or wellbeing, please use our tools, consider **Cooling‑Off** or **Self‑Exclusion**, and contact **Customer Support** for confidential assistance.

5. **Review and Updates of this Policy**
This **Safer Gambling Policy** may be updated to reflect changes in laws, regulations, or Company procedures. Material changes will be posted on the **Website**. Your continued use of the **Website** after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised **Policy**.

**Contact Us:** If you need assistance with **Safer Gambling**, please contact **Customer Support** (e.g., **email** or **live chat**). We will help you enable any of the tools described above and work with you to keep your experience safe, fair, and enjoyable.
